# SEA-website

The source code for the Symbolic Enumeration in Algebra series website. 

---

## How to edit the website

The website is built using [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/), which helps take care of some of the HTML work. This enables a mix of HTML, CSS, and Markdown.

**One does not need `Jekyll` to edit the source code.**

If you want to view the changes made to the files locally on your own machine, you will need to install `Jekyll`.

## Installing `Jekyll`

1. Make sure the [prerequisites are met](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

2. Then run 
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

Once `Jekyll` is installed, run the following to view the website on your own machine:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Style

The website uses the [Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/clean-blog-jekyll) `Jekyll` style. We thank the creators (Start Bootstrap LLC) for releasing it with an MIT License.
