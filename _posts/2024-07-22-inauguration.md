**Alex Fink**:

1. *The Tutte polynomial as a character on a coalgebra*
- Following Dupont, Fink, Moci, [_Universal Tutte characters via combinatorial coalgebras_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09028).  The paper of [Krajewski, Moffatt, Tanasa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00814) that this one is based on may also be useful reading.

1. *The arithmetic Tutte polynomial and "matroids over rings"*
- The key papers would be Moci, [_A Tutte polynomial for toric arrangements_](https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4823); D'Adderio, Moci, [_Arithmetic matroids, the Tutte polynomial and toric arrangements_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3220); and Fink, Moci [_Matroids over a ring_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6571) and [_Polyhedra and parameter spaces for matroids over valuation rings_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01026).

1. *Lattice point counting and tautological classes*
- This would start from my work with Amanda Cameron, [_The Tutte polynomial via lattice point counting_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09859), which was motivated by Kálmán and Postnikov, [_Root polytopes, Tutte polynomials, and a duality theorem for bipartite graphs_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04449).  We will also discuss the Berget--Eur--Spink--Tseng way ([_Tautological classes of matroids_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08021)), which reinterprets my and Amanda's proof. 

1. *Coxeter matroids*
- The centre of this would be Eur, Fink, Larson, Spink, [_Signed permutohedra, delta-matroids, and beyond_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06752) and Eur, Larson, Spink, [_K-classes of delta-matroids and equivariant localization_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02550), which investigate the type BC case.
