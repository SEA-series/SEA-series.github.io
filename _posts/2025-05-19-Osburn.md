### Topics and background reading

<span id="Osburn">
*Knots and modular forms*
- In 2006, Dasbach and Lin observed stability in the coefficients of the Nth colored Jones polynomial for alternating knots. This observation and its consequences sparked a flurry of activity in  both number theory and quantum topology. For example, Garoufalidis, Le and Zagier conjectured identities which have a  striking resemblance to those occurring in the classical setting of Andrews and Gordon. In these talks, we discuss these developments and recent joint work with Matthias Storzer (UCD) which connects arborescent links and modular forms.
